# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to demonstrate the HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git skills that I learned in preparation for the Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp. The project gives website visitors the basic information they would need to start learning coding skills themselves. Personally, I learned the basics of how HTML provides structure to webpages, how CSS allows you to style a webpage, how JavaScript gives interactivity to the webpage, and how GitHub/Git makes it easy to manage and track each version of the projects you create.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide contains notes about the 4 essentials of coding a webpage. These are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. The notes are organized by section and serve as a starting point for learning how to code with each of these tools. If you inspect the page and open the DevTools console you can see the Javascript running. To open the Devtool consoles you can either right click on the page and select Inspect at the bottom of the menu or use the keyboard by typing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). The Javascript elements list the topics that I learned and chooses a topic for you to study first.
